# Kernel-CLustering-with-Sigmoid-based-Regularization

## Introduction

This page contains source code for Kernel Clustering with Sigmoid-based Regularization (KCSR) for sequence segmentation. All the functions have been written and documented in Matlab format. Not that this implementation has no embedded C or C++ files (.mex). Therefore, it requires no any futher installation or compilation.
